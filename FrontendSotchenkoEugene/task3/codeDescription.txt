Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of the computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns found in the provided React code, along with a refactored version to improve performance and maintainability. Additionally, I will provide a simple HTML and CSS structure along with a README.md file for the project.
Issues and Anti-Patterns
**********************************************************************************************************************
Inefficient Sorting:
The sortedBalances array is being filtered and sorted in a single useMemo call. This can lead to unnecessary computations if the balances array is large. Sorting should ideally be done only when necessary.
Incorrect Variable Usage:
The variable lhsPriority is referenced but not defined in the filtering logic. This will cause a runtime error.
Redundant Mapping:
The formattedBalances and rows are derived from sortedBalances, but formattedBalances is not used anywhere in the component. This leads to wasted computation.
Using Index as Key:
Using the index of the array as a key in React lists can lead to issues with component state and performance. It is better to use a unique identifier for each item.
Lack of Type Safety:
The getPriority function uses any for the blockchain parameter, which defeats the purpose of TypeScript's type safety. It should be typed appropriately.
Unnecessary Re-renders:
If prices changes frequently, it can cause unnecessary re-renders. Only derive values that depend on prices when necessary.

So now it looks something like this...


Something like that, very confused!
