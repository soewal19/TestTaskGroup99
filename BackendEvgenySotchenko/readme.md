# Project Title: TestTask for Backend Developer position

## Project Description

This project consists of three main tasks that demonstrate different aspects of programming in TypeScript, including algorithm implementations and building a backend server. The tasks are as follows:

### Task 4: Three Ways to Sum to N

This task involves providing three unique implementations of a function that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`. Each implementation should be efficient and well-commented, with an analysis of its time and space complexity.

#### Implementations:
- **sum_to_n_a**: A simple iterative approach.
- **sum_to_n_b**: A mathematical formula approach.
- **sum_to_n_c**: A recursive approach.

### Task 5: A Crude Server

This task requires the development of a backend server using ExpressJS and TypeScript. The server should provide a set of CRUD operations to manage resources, including creating, listing, updating, and deleting resources. The server will connect to a database for data persistence.

#### Features:
- Create a resource.
- List resources with basic filters.
- Get details of a resource.
- Update resource details.
- Delete a resource.

### Task 6: Architecture

This task involves writing a specification for a software module in the API service. The specification includes documentation for the module, a flow diagram illustrating the execution process, and additional comments for improvement.

#### Requirements:
- A scoreboard that shows the top 10 user scores.
- Live updates of the scoreboard.
- API calls to update scores upon user actions.
- Security measures to prevent unauthorized score updates.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-repo.git
   cd project-repo

Install the dependencies:
bash
npm install

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables.
Start the server in development mode:
bash
npm run dev

Usage
For Task 4, run the implementations to see the results of summing integers up to n.
For Task 5, access the API endpoints to manage resources.
For Task 6, refer to the documentation and flow diagrams provided.
